I need to create static, smoke, and integration tests for the new functionality in `new_functionality.py`. I've already confirmed the file and its functions exist. I'll now create three test files in `src/test`: `test_new_functionality_static.py`, `test_new_functionality_smoke.py`, and `test_new_functionality_integration.py`. After that, I will run these tests using `pytest` and record the output in the final report.

I will begin by creating the static test file.
